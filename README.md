# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to build a webpage that accurately filters a data collection of UFO sightings.  The available filters are date, city, state, country, and shape.  This webpage allows anyone that is interested in UFO sightings to do some easy research on the topic.

## Results

To perform a search, a user needs to enter text in one or more of the filter input boxes that were created.  For instance, if someone wanted to find all of the sightings from the data that occured on 1/13/2010, they would click on the "Enter Date" text box and type "1/13/2010".  The user can do this with each of the filter options.  If they want to filter the data by city they can click on the "City" text box and type "el cajon".  The newly filtered table will appear below.

## Summary

This webpage is useful for novice UFO sighting researchers.  One drawback of this webpage is that the data presented is only based on one source, data.js.  One improvement for the webpage is to increase the amount of data sources that it is pulling from.  This will help users get more data to then analyze.  Another improvement is to add a "Comments" input box.  This would alow users to filter the data based on one or more words from the comments in order to see if a specific word is used more commonly to describe the UFO sighting.  Overall, this webpage is useful for people that are interested in UFO sightings.
